				<h1>What is Dungeons and Dragons?</h1>
				<p>
					The Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in
					worlds of swords and sorcery. Like childhood games of make-believe,
					D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the towering castle
					beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer
					might react to the challenges the scene presents.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unlike a game of make believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a
					way of determining the consequences of the adventurers action. Players
					roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether
					their adventurers can scale a cliff, or pull off some other dangerous
					task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more
					probable than others.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the D&D game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a
					character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends).
					Working together, the group may explore a dark dungeon, haunted
					castle, a lost temple, or more.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h1>Where to start?</h1>
				<p>
					The first step in starting your D&D adventure is to create a
					character. Each adventurer is a member of a class, which broadly
					describes the special talents they possess and the tactics he or she
					is most likely to employ in battle or while exploring. Your character
					receives a number of benefits from your choice of class including a
					number of proficiencies (armor, weapons, skills). Your proficiencies
					define many of the things your character can do particularly well,
					from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie. While
					adventurers may advance in more than one class as time goes on, the
					twelve basic classes can be generally categorized into three groups.

				<h1 class="class-header">The Path of Strength...</h1>
				<div class="class-container">

					<p>
						Strength measures a character’s muscle, endurance and stamina. This
						ability is the prime requisite of warriors because they must be
						physically powerful in order to wear armor and wield heavy weapons.
						Exceptional strength improves the character's chance to hit an
						enemy, increases the damage he causes with each hit, increases the
						weight the character is able to carry without a penalty for
						encumbrance, and increases the character's ability to force open
						doors and similar portals.

				<h1 class="class-header">The Path of Support...</h1>
				<div class="class-container">
					<p>
						Support characters may not be able to take as much damage or cast as
						many spells as others, but their unique toolkit of skills is their
						route to success. Often a skill of high importance is dexterity,
						which encompasses several physical attributes including hand-eye
						coordination, agility, reaction speed, reflexes, and balance.
						Dexterity affects a character's reaction to a threat or surprise,
						his accuracy with thrown weapons and bows, and his ability to dodge
						an enemy's blows.

				<h1 class="class-header">The Path of Spellcasting...</h1>
				<div class="class-container">
					<img src="images/DnD_Efreeti.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						Spellcasters mainly rely on specializing in intelligence.
						Intelligence represents a character's memory, reasoning, and
						learning ability, including areas outside those measured by the
						written word. Intelligence dictates the number of languages a
						character can learn and iis the prime requisite of many magic users,
						who must have keen minds to understand and memorize magical spells.
						The magic user’s intelligence dictates which spells he can learn and
						the number of spells he can memorize at one time.
